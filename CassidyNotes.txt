Requirements:
- guests should be prevented from liking or disliking
  - guests should get an error when they try to like/dislike
  - currently there are two versions of the homepage code, this may not continue to be the case. Ideally all of the guest/not-guest logic should be in the backend handler functions (checking sessions): HandleLikeDislike
  - there are/should be examples of checking user session validity elsewhere, copy/paste? look for checkCookie
  - the javascript in the html pages (home and guest) may need updating to pass cookies for session verification
    - google: javascript fetch send cookie

- users can only like || dislike
  - question:
      - if a post is already disliked, do users have to press dislike before pressing like? - no
      - are the like/dislike buttons similar to a toggle? (pressing one automatically negates the other) - yes
    answer:
      - if post is liked then by pressing like the post is set to 0 likes and by pressing dislike the post is set to 0 likes & 1 dislike
  - there needs to be a way of tracking if a specific user has liked/disliked a specific post
    - reactions:
      - A new struct type
      - New getter and setter (creator)
      - Remove likes and dislikes from comments and posts (replace them with reactions)
        - remove from struct types and fix problems

- the buttons for like/dislike need updating to use the pngs from the cassidy branch and update the html

- on a user's profile they need to be able to see the a list of their liked posts/comments (think, reddit)
  - needs to be based on reactions
  - likes.html needs some templating with range
  - links to likes.html need checking
  - needs a handler?

- when viewing posts individually or through categories, user/guest cannot like/dislike the posts - needs to be changed
