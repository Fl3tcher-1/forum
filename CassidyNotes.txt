Requirements:
- guests should be prevented from liking or disliking
  - guests should get an error when they try to like/dislike
  - currently there are two versions of the homepage code, this may not continue to be the case. Ideally all of the guest/not-guest logic should be in the backend handler functions (checking sessions)
  - checking user session validity should be elsewhere, copy/paste?
  - the javascript in the html pages may need updating to pass cookies for session verification
- users can only like || dislike
  - question:
      - if a post is already disliked, do users have to press dislike before pressing like? - no
      - are the like/dislike buttons similar to a toggle? (pressing one automatically negates the other) - yes
    answer:
      - if post is liked then by pressing like the post is set to 0 likes and by pressing dislike the post is set to 0 likes & 0 dislikes

- on a user's profile they need to be able to see the a list of their liked posts/comments (think, reddit)
